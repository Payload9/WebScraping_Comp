# Entry for Web Scraping Competiton

This is my entry for the intermediate-level Python web scraping challenge for YTAC (Cohort 8).

# Running the Program

## The Easy Way

1. Download the pre-compiled program from the [releases](https://github.com/Payload9/WebScraping_Comp/releases/latest) page.
2. Run `Webscraping_Comp.exe`.

## The Slightly Complicated Way

### Windows

1. [Download and install the latest version of Python 3 if you haven't already.](https://www.python.org/downloads/)

2. Open the command prompt and type in `cd <full path to Webscraping_Comp folder>`. For example, if the folder is located in the downloads folder, you would type `cd C:\Users\<YourUsername>\Downloads\Webscraping_Comp`. (replace <YourUsername> with whatever your Windows username is)

3. Install the required modules by typing `py ModuleInstaller.py` 

4. Once the modules are installed, run the program by typing `py main.py`.

### Linux

1. Install the latest Python 3. Exact steps to do so vary across distros.

2. Open the terminal and type `cd <full path to Webscraping_Comp folder>`. For example, if the folder is located in the downloads folder, you would type `cd ./Downloads/Webscraping_Comp`.

3. Install the required modules by typing `python3 ModuleInstaller.py`.

4. Once the modules are installed, run the program by typing `python3 main.py`.

Additional Notes:

* Do **not** run this program from an online interpreter. It won't run.
